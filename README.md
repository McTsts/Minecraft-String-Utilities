# Strings
Reads strings in minecraft


Simple datapack that converts a string into a char array

1. Run `function string:helper/build` in a commandblock to create the command block stuff
2. `/data modify storage string:in in set value "aaauoajfafhiahadi36ajaSAHD"` to put in a string
3. Press the button next to the impulse command block to start
4. `/data get storage string:out out to get the char array`
