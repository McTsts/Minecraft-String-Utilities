# Strings
Simple datapack that converts a string into a char array.


1. Run `function string:helper/build` in a commandblock to create the command block stuff
2. `data modify storage string:in in set value "aaauoajfafhiahadi36ajaSAHD"` to put in a string
3. Press the button next to the impulse command block to start
4. `data get storage string:out out` to get the char array
