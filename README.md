# Strings
Simple datapack that converts a string into a char array.


1. Run `function string:helper/build` in a commandblock to create the command block stuff (you will receive this command automatically)
2. `data modify storage string:in in set value {string:"abcde"}` to put in a string
3. `function string:do/read` to read the string
4. `data get storage string:out out` to get the char array


This is possible thanks to:
