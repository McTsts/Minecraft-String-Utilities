# Strings
Reads strings in minecraft


Simple datapack that converts a string into a char array

(Run function string:helper/build in a commandblock to create the command block stuff

/data modify storage string:in in set value "aaauoajfafhiahadi36ajaSAHD" to put in a string
(It's limited to Base64 characters + a few extra characters see run/id_to_char) 

Press the button next to the impulse command block to start

/data get storage string:out out to get the char array


This is possible thanks to:
